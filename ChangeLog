* Update boards.txt - there are now two entries for the optiboot boards as a hopefully temporary solution to changes in how bootloader .hex file location is specified. For non-optiboot, it doesn't matter, since 1.0.6 would just fail to write the flash which we're not writing anyway.
* Update pins_arduino.h to define SPI pins.
* Remove bogus programmer entries from boards.txt

3/14/2015:
* Optiboot works.
* Update readme.
