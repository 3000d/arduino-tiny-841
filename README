
Arduino-Tiny-841 is a fork of the is an open source Arduino-Tiny project (by way of shimniok's fork)

This fork provides support for the Attiny841/441 processors. These are a
remarkable Attiny processor in the SOIC-14 package. It is pin compatible
with the Attiny84, however, it's onboard peripherals are much improved.
It supports 6 PWM outputs (3 timers), has two hardware UARTs, and real
hardware SPI (as opposed to the USI used in the '84 and '85), as well as
having an ADC channel on every pin.  

This includes Optiboot for the ATTiny841. 

If you installed this core prior to 3/14/2015, you must replace the previous entry in avrdude.conf with the new one. The efuse was not being read correctly.

INSTALLATION

First ensure the Arduino software is correctly installed, and that the IDE is not running during the installation process. 


* Locate your Arduino Sketch folder.  This is the folder where the Arduino IDE
  stores Sketches, typically located in your Documents folder. 

* Ensure the "hardware" folder exists under the Arduino Sketch folder. If it is not there, create it. 

* Download Arduino-Tiny-841 from github as a ZIP file, and extract it into the 
  "hardware" folder, or simply clone the github repo into there.  For example,
  if the Arduino Sketch folder is...

      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino

  After extracting, the following files / folders should exist...

      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\LICENSE
      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\avrdude_conf.txt
      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\Boards.txt
      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\ChangeLog
      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\README
      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\README.md
      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\platform.txt
      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\programmers.txt
      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\bootloaders\
      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\cores\

  The following folder should contain the source files for the Arduino-Tiny
  core...

      C:\Users\YourName\Documents\Arduino\hardware\arduino-tiny-841\cores\

* Locate avrdude.conf - typically in 
  C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\tools\avr\etc 

* If you are using Windows Vista or later, right-click avrdude.conf and
  choose the Security tab. Select "Users", and see if there is a checkmark 
  in the "Allow" column for "Full Control". If not, click Edit, select Users, 
  and click the checkbox to Allow Full Control. Apply.

* Open avrdude.conf using any text editor. Copy/paste the contents of 
  avrdude_conf.txt onto the end of avrdude.conf and save. 

IF YOU ARE USING ARDUINO 1.6:

* open the arduino-tiny-841 folder, and create a new folder named "avr". 
  Move the cores, libraries, and bootloaders folders, as well as boards.txt, platform.txt, and programmers.txt into "avr"

IF YOU ARE USING ARDUINO 1.0.x, you must update the compiler toolchain. 
  
* Download and install Atmel Studio 6.2 (available from the Atmel website). 

* Locate the location of the Arduino toolchain, typically in:

  C:\Program Files (x86)\Arduino\tools\avr

* If using Windows Vista or later, right-click avr folder, Security tab. 
  Select "Users", and see if there is a checkmark in the "Allow" column for
  "Full Control". If not, click Edit, select Users, and click the checkbox
  to Allow Full Control. Apply.

* Copy the AVR toolchain from Atmel Studio over the old Arduino Toolchain, 
  replacing files when prompted. 

  C:\Program Files\Atmel\Atmel Toolchain\AVR8 GCC\Native\(version)\avr8-gnu-toolchain

  You must leave the old toolchain there, and copy these over it, because
  there are files needed by Arduino in addition to the toolchain that are
  located in the same directory. 



You are now ready to use the Arduino-Tiny-841 core!
